# cmd-run-algorithm
This package allow you to run classes function from command line. This can help with running multiple configuration for algorithms without changing the code or making any special adapters

- You can use list type by setting the parameter multiple times `python run class --param 1 --param 23` 

Notes:
- If you use typing types, you'll have to specify the type using _type param. This feature is in development.
`python run class --param_type int --param 1`
- List param can only by used by primitive types currently
